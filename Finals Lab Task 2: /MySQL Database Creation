### 3. Create the submission table:
- Define username and shortname both as VARCHAR(50).
- Define version as an INT.
- Define submit_date as a DATE NOT NULL.

- Add foreign keys referencing the student and assignment tables.

# Table Relationships
### 1. **`student` table**
- **Primary Key:** `username`
- **Relationships:**
  - **One-to-Many** relationship with `submission`
    - One student (`username`) can have **many submissions**.

### 2. **`assignment` table**
- **Primary Key:** `shortname`
- **Relationships:**
  - **One-to-Many** relationship with `submission`
    - One assignment (`shortname`) can have **many submissions** from different students (or multiple versions from the same student).

### 3. **`submission` table**
- **Composite Primary Key:** `(username, shortname, version)`
- **Relationships:**
  - **Many-to-One** with `student`
    - Each submission belongs to **one student**.
  - **Many-to-One** with `assignment`
    - Each submission is for **one assignment**.
  - Overall, it represents a many-to-many relationship between students and assignments, with a version to track multiple submissions.
