## Table Manipulation Using MySQL:Sample screenshot and how it works depend of what he needs.

# Step by Step Process:
1. **Create the Table**  
   - Make a table named `products`.  
   - Add three fields:  
     - `id` (auto-increment and primary key)  
     - `product_name` (text up to 100 characters, cannot be empty)  
     - `price` (decimal number)

2. **Add a Rule**  
   - Add a `CHECK` constraint to make sure the `price` is more than 0.

3. **Insert Valid Products**  
   - Only add products with a positive price:
     - Laptop – 999.99  
     - Smartphone – 599.99  
     - Tablet – 299.99  
     - Keyboard – 19.99  
     - Mouse – 14.99  
     - Desk Lamp – 24.99  
     - Speakers – 9.99  
   - Skip items with negative prices.

4. **Update the Table**  
   - Change the `product_name` field to allow up to 120 characters.
