This portfolio contains an imformation due to use power query: 
- In today’s fast-paced world finding moments of focus and calm can often seem like a challenge. However two activities—reading and coding—offer more than just a way to pass the time. They have the power to enrich our lives in unique ways blending creativity problem solving and personal growth. Whether diving into an engaging book or tackling a coding problem both experiences allow us to expand our minds and skills.

- This project aims to explore how reading and coding while seemingly different work together to make life more exciting and rewarding. Reading opens our minds to new ideas and worlds while coding turns concepts into real-world applications. Together they offer opportunities for creativity critical thinking, and even personal transformation.

- Through this exploration I hope to demonstrate how incorporating both reading and coding into your life can not only improve problem-solving abilities but also add a sense of adventure and fulfillment to your everyday routine.
